**Counter App!**

1. Create three new components: `CounterControl`, `Increment`, and `Decrement`.  
2. The `CounterControl` Component should have two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement".
3. The `CounterControl` Component should also display the current counter value, which starts from 0.
4. When the "Increment" button is clicked, an event should be emitted to increase the counter by 1. This should be reflected in the `Increment` component which displays the message "Incremented to - NUMBER".
5. When the "Decrement" button is clicked, an event should be emitted to decrease the counter by 1. This should be reflected in the `Decrement` component which displays the message "Decremented to - NUMBER".
6. The `Increment` and `Decrement` components should also display the total number of times their respective buttons have been clicked.
7. Style the `Increment` component to have a green background and the `Decrement` component to have a red background.
8. Add a feature such that if the counter value becomes negative, the displayed counter value in `CounterControl` component turns red.
9. Implement a reset button in `CounterControl` to reset the counter value to 0.
10. Add a feature in the `CounterControl` component where the user can set a custom step value. For example, if the step is set to 5, clicking the "Increment" button will increase the counter by 5, and the "Decrement" button will decrease it by 5.
